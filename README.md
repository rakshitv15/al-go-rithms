# Data Structures and Algorithms 

Clean example implementations of data structures and algorithms written in different languages.

## List of implementations
[Algorithms list](https://github.com/ZoranPandovski/al-go-rithms/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md)

## Contribution
 * Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.
 * PRs are welcome. To begin developing, follow the structure:

   > algorithm_name/language-name/file_name.extension
   e.g
   > bubble_sort/python/bubble_sort.py

 * If there is an implementation of the same algorithm in your language, add your username in front of the file name.
 * Please include a description for the algorithm that you are implementing. It doesn't matter if it's copied from somewhere as long as it helps people that are learning new algorithm.
 * Graphical examples would be very helpful too.
 * Don't forget to include tests.
 * Don't remove previous implementations of algorithms. Just add a new file with your own implementation.
 * Beautify and cleanup your code for easier reading
